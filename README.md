## Description
Advena is a social event planning app that helps solo travellers and locals discover, create, and join activities with ease. Users can browse events by location, group size, cost, and tags, RSVP seamlessly, and host their own gatherings in just a few steps. By removing the stress of coordination and making it simple to connect with both strangers and friends, Advena transforms solo travel and city living into opportunities for meaningful connections, allowing people to focus on enjoying experiences and building new relationships.

## Grading Instructions
Please consider that the emulator can sometimes be very slow, so after moving the map allow for a moment for events to load. If no events show up after a moment or two, there might not be any events in the DB for that date so try expanding the date range. A majority of our events have been concentrated in North America and Europe.

Also note that the emulator default sets the phone's location to Google HQ in SF. If you want it to take your default location you have to configure that manually in the emulator settings.
