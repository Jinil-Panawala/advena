## Description
Advena is a social event planning app that helps solo travellers and locals discover, create, and join activities with ease. Users can browse events by location, group size, cost, and tags, RSVP seamlessly, and host their own gatherings in just a few steps. By removing the stress of coordination and making it simple to connect with both strangers and friends, Advena transforms solo travel and city living into opportunities for meaningful connections, allowing people to focus on enjoying experiences and building new relationships.
