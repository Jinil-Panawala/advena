# Navigating The Home Page
After signing up / logging in, you will be directed to the home screen of the app. This is a Google maps interface which will show events from around the world (based on their visibility settings) that satisfy your current event filters. Events are shown as markers on the maps interface. There are 3 types of event markers which correspond to that event's visibility:
- Red markers represent public events
- Blue markers represent follower only events
- Orange markers represent friend only events (both you and the event host must follow each other)


Clicking on an event marker will open a modal allowing you to RSVP to it and view details like occupancy and cost.

Click `Save` to apply those preferences. This will then only show events on the map which satisfy your preferences. Furthermore, you can search for events by typing in the search bar on the top, and typing for particular event names or tags.
